CrowdQR is a web-based platform that allows live audiences to engage with DJs during performances by scanning a QR code to submit and vote on song requests in real time. DJs can manage requests through a secure admin interface, allowing them to curate sets dynamically based on audience feedback.

This app is built as part of a Software Engineering Capstone project and is designed to demonstrate full-stack development, real-time systems, and containerized deployment.

## 🎯 Project Vision & Goal

### ✅ Vision

Empower independent DJs and small venue performers to create more interactive, engaging sets by digitizing audience participation — no shouting requests, no pen-and-paper lists.

### ✅ Core Goals

- Provide a mobile-friendly interface for users to submit and vote on song requests
- Equip DJs with a live dashboard to approve/reject requests
- Enable real-time updates without page refreshes
- Prevent spam, duplicate votes, and request flooding via backend logic
- Support event-based session tracking and persistent request queues
- Deploy everything inside Docker containers for portability

---

## 📌 Use Cases

- 🎧 **DJ Admin** logs into the dashboard and sees live requests and vote counts
- 👥 **Audience Member** scans a QR code, types a song name, and votes on others' requests
- 🔄 Requests are approved/rejected by the DJ and synced in real time
- 🔒 Voting is limited per user/session to prevent abuse

---

## 📖 How to Use CrowdQR

### 🎧 For DJs

1. **Register as a DJ**
   - Visit the web application at `http://localhost:8080`
   - Click "Register" and check "Register as a DJ"

3. **Generate QR Code**
   - From the Events page, click the QR Code button for your event
   - Display the QR code on screens or print it for your venue
   - The QR code contains the URL: `http://localhost:8080/event/your-event-slug`

4. **Manage Requests**
   - Go to Admin → Dashboard and select your event
   - View pending requests sorted by vote count
   - Approve ✅ or reject ❌ requests in real-time
   - See live updates as audience members vote
   - Switch between Pending, Approved, and Rejected tabs

5. **Monitor Activity**
   - View active user count and total requests
   - Search requests by song, artist, or requester name
   - Track request statistics and popular songs

### 👥 For Audience Members

1. **Join an Event**
   - Scan the QR code displayed at the venue, OR

- **Active Users**: DJs can see how many audience members are connected
- **Auto-Refresh**: No need to refresh the page - everything updates automatically

### 🎯 Tips for Best Results

**For DJs:**

- Keep events active during your set for audience engagement
- Regularly check the dashboard during performances
- Use the search feature to find specific requests quickly
- Consider approving popular requests to keep the audience engaged

**For Audience:**

- Be specific with song names and artists for better recognition
- Vote for requests you genuinely want to hear
- Check back periodically to see if your requests were approved
- Respect the DJ's musical direction and choices

### 🚨 Troubleshooting

- **Can't connect?** Check that ports 5000 and 8080 are accessible
- **QR code not working?** Ensure the event slug is correct and the event is active
- **Requests not appearing?** Verify your internet connection and refresh the page
- **Vote not counting?** You may have already voted for that request
