# ðŸŽ§ CrowdQR â€“ Real-Time DJ Audience Interaction App

CrowdQR is a web-based platform that allows live audiences to engage with DJs during performances by scanning a QR code to submit and vote on song requests in real time. DJs can manage requests through a secure admin interface, allowing them to curate sets dynamically based on audience feedback.

This app is built as part of a Software Engineering Capstone project and is designed to demonstrate full-stack development, real-time systems, and containerized deployment.

## ðŸŽ¯ Project Vision & Goals

### âœ… Vision
Empower independent DJs and small venue performers to create more interactive, engaging sets by digitizing audience participation â€” no shouting requests, no pen-and-paper lists.

### âœ… Core Goals
- Provide a mobile-friendly interface for users to submit and vote on song requests
- Equip DJs with a live dashboard to approve/reject requests
- Enable real-time updates without page refreshes
- Prevent spam, duplicate votes, and request flooding via backend logic
- Support event-based session tracking and persistent request queues
- Deploy everything inside Docker containers for portability

---

## ðŸ“Œ Use Cases

- ðŸŽ§ **DJ Admin** logs into the dashboard and sees live requests and vote counts
- ðŸ‘¥ **Audience Member** scans a QR code, types a song name, and votes on others' requests
- ðŸ”„ Requests are approved/rejected by the DJ and synced in real time
- ðŸ”’ Voting is limited per user/session to prevent abuse
